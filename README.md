## Basic Data Structures

### ArrayList
An implementation of a resizable array, similar to the built-in `ArrayList` in Java.

### LinkedList
A doubly linked list implementation, providing efficient insertion and deletion operations.

### Queue
A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure implementation.

### Stack
A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure implementation.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, with the left child having a smaller value and the right child having a larger value.

### Binary Tree
A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.

## Intermediate Data Structures

### Heap
A complete binary tree which satisfies the heap property, useful for priority queue implementations.

### PriorityQueue
An advanced queue that allows for the retrieval of elements according to their priority.

### BlockingQueue
A thread-safe queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element and wait for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.

### Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
A queue that supports insertion and removal of elements from both ends.

## Advanced Data Structures

### HashMap
A data structure that implements a map interface using hashing for efficient key-value pair storage.

### Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
A data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets, useful for Kruskal's algorithm and network connectivity.

### Red-Black Tree
A balanced binary search tree with additional properties to ensure the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.

### AVL Tree
A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

### B-Tree
A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

### Graph
A data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes, useful for representing networks and relationships.

## Algorithms

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting from the root and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting from the root and exploring all neighbor nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

### Kruskal's Algorithm
An algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph, which finds a subset of the edges that connects all vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
